# Background
Duck Hunt is an 80's retro game where the player takes Dog to go duck hunting. In this project to create a clone of the game, the player will "hunt" the flying ducks using their mouse or trackpad. Points are given for successful hunts and the player has 3 lives - or 3 misses - before the game over.

# Functionality
In Duck Hunt, users will be able to:
* Use a trackpad or mouse click to hunt a duck
* Gain points when successfully hunting
* Lose a life if the duck is missed
* Lose the round if the time limit runs out

In addition, this project will include:
* Background music
* Dog sound effects
* Button to toggle sounds ON/OFF
