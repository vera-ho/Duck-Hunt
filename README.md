# Background
Duck Hunt is an 80's retro game where the player takes Dog to go duck hunting. In this project, the player will "hunt" the flying ducks using their mouse or trackpad. Points are given for successful hunts and the player has 3 lives - or 3 misses - before the game over.

# Functionality
In Duck Hunt, users will be able to:
* Use a trackpad or mouse click to hunt a duck
* Gain points when successfully hunting
* Lose a life if the duck is missed
* Lose the round if the time limit runs out

In addition, this project will include:
* Background music
* Dog sound effects
* Button to toggle sounds ON/OFF
